        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>After our baby mushrooms have grown and filled out a petri dish we move them to a jar of grain. 
            The most popular grain to use is oats. Like the kind that horses eat. Mushrooms are very cool in the way
            they grow. On the petri dish they grow as a 2-dimensional life form. Once they have ingested enough 
            nutrients and have gotten strong enough they're ready to start growing in 3 dimensions. To do that
            we cook and sterilize jars of grains. We will then cut up the petri dishes and toss them in those jars. 
            This recipe is how to get your jars ready for our babies!

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 6 - 10 cups of oats in a large pot.</li>
            <li>Fill the pot up about 2/3 of the way full. There should be much more water than oats.</li>
            <li>Put a lid on it and boil the oats for 30 minutes to an hour. Check on the oats frequently. You Want
                as few burst oats as possible. They should be semi-hard but breakable so the inner part of the oat can easily be
                squeezed out. 
            </li>
            <li>You can work on the next step while your oats are boiling.</li>
            <li>First you are going to drill a hole in the middle of the lid of your mason jar. The hole should be about 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>Next you will poke pillow stuffing through the hole. At this point mushrooms need carbon monoxide
                rather than oxygen to colonize. Poke stuffing in and lightly pull it through the other side. 
            </li>
            <li>Your jars are ready</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once your oats are done cooking run the oats and water through a strainer. Leave the oats in the strainer. 
                You may want to put the strainer on a plate with a towel on it. You want your oats to be as dry as possible. 
                This may take a few hours. 
            </li>
            
            <li>Once your oats are dry fill up your jars 1/3 of the way to halfway full at the most. No more than this.</li>
            <li>Put the lids on loosely. Cover with tinfoil as before.</li>
            <li>Put your jars in your pressure cook and cook at 15 psi for two hours</li>
            <li>Once your pressure cooker normalizes to zero you may take your jars out. Tighten the lids and keep the tin foil on</li>
            <li>If the oats in the jars are wet or sticky leave them to dry out for a few hours, up to a day. The pressure cooker sterilizes 
                them so you want to make sure they are sealed tight so nothing can get in there. 
            </li>
            <li>Your jars are completely ready for babies!</li>
