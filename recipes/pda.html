        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The first stage in growing mushrooms is putting mushroom spores on petri dishes
            We won't worry about the spores for now. For now this will be a guide on how to make petri dishes.
            Agar is a powder that is derived from seaweed. When water is added it forms something that
            is extremely similar to gelatin. The agar is the base and we will need to add a few ingredients
            to give nutrients to our baby mushrooms. Everyone's gotta eat! 
        </p>

        <h4>Tools</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Pot</li>
            <li>Mason Jar</li>
            <li>Aluminum Foil</li>
            <li>Pressure Cooker</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Water - <em>500 milliliters</em></li>
            <li>Agar-Agar Powder - <em> 10 Grams</em></li>
            <li>Dextrose or Honey/Corn Syrup - <em>7 Grams or 10 milliliters</em></li>
            <li>Yeast - <em>1 Gram</em></li>
            <li>Potato Flakes - <em>5 Grams</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put water into a pot and set over low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the ingredients and heat the media until the ingredients have melted as much as possible
                The agar wil begin to gum up and turn into gelatin. If it doesn't dissolve all the way that is ok.
                Do not let the media boil as it will caramelize and those sugars are toxic to mushrooms.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the media from a pot into a mason jar. Don't screw the lid on all the way</li>
            <li>Put tin foil over the top of the jar to prevent water from getting in. </li>
            <li>Let the agar cook in the pressure cooker at 15 psi for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Once your pressure cooker normalizes to 0 psi you make take the jar out to let it cool</li>
            <li>Tighten the lid and take the tinfoil off.</li>
            <li>You now have a jar of sterilized agar that can be put into petri dishes later!

            <li>You may store this in your fridge until use. </li>
        </ol>
