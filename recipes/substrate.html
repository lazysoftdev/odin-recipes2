        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Once your mushrooms have colonized the grains, or fully grown in a 3D space, they are ready for the final step. 
            Most of what 'mushrooms' are are this white fluffy mass that is filling the jars. What mushrooms are, the mushrooms that we are used to
            are the reproductive organ of the mycelium. Yes what we eat and are trying to grow are the penises of the mushroom. 
            The tops of the mushroom sprout their little hats we are so familiar with and drop spores, microscopic 'seeds' in order for
            more mushrooms and mycelial masses to spawn.

        <p>This recipe is how to grow the substrate, the finally growing home for our babies. This is the most basic recipe possible
            for mushroom substrate. </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Plastic Tub</li>
            <li>Boiling Water</li>
            <li>Coco Coir</li>
            <li>A large tub or pot for mixing</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a large pot of water</li>
            <li>Break off chunks of coco coir</li>
            <li>Put the coco coir in the pot you plan on using to mix</li>
            <li>Dump boiling water over the coir and let it sit until it is cool enough to mix by hand</li>
            <li>The coir should expand. Break it up with your hand. If it is too dry add more water incrementally. You want the
                coir to be light and spongy and not to wet. But you want to be able to squeeze a handful of it and for drops of water
                to come out. Just a little water. 
            </li>
            <li>Put the amount of coco coir you are going to use in your tub. </li>
            <li>Depeneding on the size of your tub take 1 - 6 jars of colonized grain to throw in your tub. </li>
            <li>Break the jars apart as much as you can. This is achieved by smacking them against your hand. Dump the 
                jars into your coir tub. 
            </li>
            <li>With your hands, and this is safe to do gloveless but gloves are recommended, mix the grain spawn into the coir. 
                Do this thorougly until both are evenly mixed. You may have to scrape the corners and edges of the tub along with the 
                bottom to achieve this. 
            </li>
            <li>Now shake the tub a little to even it out. Next, by hand, even the substrate mix out. You want the surface to be as level as
                possible. 
            </li>
            <li>Throw a little coir on the top of your substrate. 
                This is called a casing layer and protects the spawn/substrate mix below.
                Once again even this out gently with your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Now put your lid on and your substrate tubs are finished!</li>
            <li>Let our babies grow and no longer be babies!</li>
