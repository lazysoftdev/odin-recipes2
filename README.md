# odin-recipes

This current project is part of The Odin Project's Foundation course for Web Development. I will be implementing a very basic HTML/CSS website to show that I grasp the basics along with practice for myself. 

It will be a recipe site using skills of inserting images, absolute and relative links into a website, using HTML elements and attributes, and basic HTML site layouts. 

This will also be practice in implementing repositories with git on my local machine and GitHub as a remote Version Control Systems. 

Hope you enjoy later when you look at this Donovan. :)

No need to think about loneliness and that girl.
